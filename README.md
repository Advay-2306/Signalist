## <a name="introduction">‚ú® Introduction</a>

AI-driven stock market platform built with Next.js, Shadcn, Better Auth, and Inngest. Track live prices, set custom alerts, and explore company insights. The admin dashboard enables stock management, news publishing, and user monitoring, while event-driven workflows power automated alerts, AI-generated daily summaries, and sentiment analysis‚Äîdesigned for developers building dynamic, real-time financial applications. Below are various technolgies I have utilized in building this project.

## <a name="tech-stack">‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack</a>

- **[Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)** is a framework-agnostic authentication and authorization library for TypeScript. It provides built-in support for email/password login, social sign-on (Google, GitHub, Apple, and more), and multi-factor authentication, simplifying user authentication and account management.

- **[CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/)** is an AI-powered code review assistant that integrates with GitHub. It helps developers catch bugs, enforce best practices, and maintain consistent code quality across pull requests, reducing manual review effort and speeding up the development workflow.

- **[Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/)** is a real-time financial data API that provides stock, forex, and cryptocurrency market data. It offers developers access to fundamental data, economic indicators, and news, making it useful for building trading apps, dashboards, and financial analysis tools.

- **[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/)** is a platform for event-driven workflows and background jobs. It allows developers to build reliable, scalable automated processes such as real-time alerts, notifications, and AI-powered workflows.
